/** @Function Description:  This function registers an ISR. If the function is
  *                         successful, the requested interrupt is enabled, isr
  *                         and isr_context parameters updated to vector table
  *                         upon return. Calls to this function replace
  *                         previously registered handler for interrupt irq.
  *                         If isr is set to null, the interrupt is disabled.
  * @API Type:              External
  * @param ic_id            The interrupt controller ID.
  * @param irq              IRQ number
  * @param isr              isr is the function that is called  when the 
  *                         interrupt is active, isr_context is the input 
  *                         arguments to isr.
  * @param isr_context      pointer of type void*. The isr_context points to a 
  *                         per-instance data structure associate with the 
  *                         device driver instance. The isr_context is passed  
  *                         as the input argument to the isr function.
  * @param flags            TBD
  * @return                 0 if successful, else error (-1)
  *
  * Note:  Users who locate their ISR codes directly to vector table must not
  *        call to this function.
